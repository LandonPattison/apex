# Apex

Mindset App
This project uses Expo for audio functionality, and all code is kept in one file for speed. I had no prior experience with React Native, only React on the web.

Improvements for the App
- Tasks without audio/video should not show a play button, just let the user complete them.
- Consider using GPT's new voice to generate audio clips or allow users to have conversations about what they've learned.
  
To-Do
- loading screen
- Update task cards to show the amount of minutes and improve text styling.
- Update task cards to show the proper look when a task is completed.
- Improve navigation styling.
- Add functionality for users to take notes.
- skeleton for data fetching logic in code
